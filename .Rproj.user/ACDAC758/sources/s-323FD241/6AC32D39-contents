This document explain the code to replicate the results in *Production Rigidity, Input Lumpiness, Efficiency,
and the Technological Hurdle of Quebec Dairy Farms* published in the Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics.

The results in the paper were produced using Stata. The Stata file `Rigidity_lumpiness_efficiency_hurdle.do` contains the code to generate the results in the paper. 

The file `Replication of Larue, Pouliot & Singbo (2017).Rmd` reproduces the results in the paper using R. The file also generates other figures in the paper that were produced using R and prepares the data for estimation.
